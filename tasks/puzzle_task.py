    # 2.	All clues should be numerated.
    # 3.	Each clues should be only 1 sentence.
    # 4.	INSTRUCTION TO WORK WITH CLUES:
    # 5.	ALL CLUES MUST BE BASED ON A SWL information.
    # 6.	There could be POSITIVE clues: (e.g. person (without name) with attribute was seen near attribute of location or location name).
    # 7.	There could be negative clues: (e.g. person  (without name) with attribute wasnâ€™t seen with attribute weapon)
    # 8.	Most of clues should be positive.
    # 9.	All clues should be lead to make conclusion that gives results same as SWL information.
    # 10.	Do not provide a clues by direct name of weapon, suspect or location. Preferably Clues should have attributes of weapon, location or suspect, than their names.
    # 11.	You can do exception only 2 times one for one obvious weapon, and one time for location. That means you must user direct location name only once, and only once for weapon name. But both mustnâ€™t be related to murder.
    # 12.	MUST: ONLY last clue could be related to murder weapon, location and killer. Show location of the murder and condition of the body. This condition could be additional clue and help to identify murder weapon, but it should not describe of Attributes of murder weapon. Only approach. Only last clue should lead to place and weapon of murder. Here you can describe direct location.
    # 13.	MUST: There have not me a clue connected real killer to murder location.
    # 14.	MUST: There have not be any clue that describe where killer was, and no any killer attributes should not related to any location.
    # 15.	MUST: There have not be a clue connected real killer to murder weapon.
    # 16.	MUST: There have not be a clue connected murder weapon to murder location.

    # 18.	There should be no misleading statements. If users didnâ€™t ask for it.
    # 19.	Clues should not contradict each other.
    # 20.	There should not be any clues that just describe just one element. All clues should leads to some logical conclusion. Not just description of elements or their attributes.
    # 21.	There should not be clues that duplicate connection descripton.
    # 22.	Conclusions about the connection of elements must be made only from one clue, and not from several.
    # 23.	Connection to Elements: Clues should be carefully crafted to relate directly to one or more of the suspects, weapons, and locations. They should allow players to logically exclude certain combinations of these elements.
    # 24.	Clues should balance of using names of elements and their attributes.
    # 25.	DO NOT use any additional description or headend meaning of elements that user should guess. Use only names of elements and its attributes. User shouldnâ€™t do any assumption of related clues to any attribute of any element.
    # 26.	ALL ELEMENTS or their ATTRIBUTES should be bold in clues.
    # 27.	!THINK Before Creating CLUES. READ carefully rules for Clues. Count required amount off clues according to rule below. All clues should be created according to rules.
    # 28.	Do clues at first internally without printing. That solve the task according the clues. Try to get same conclusion and in SWL table. If conclusion same â€“ print clues to user. Repeat internal generation clues, until result of conclusion would be equal to SWL table
